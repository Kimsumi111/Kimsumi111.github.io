<h2>About</h2>

<p>
Hello, I'm Kim Sumi.
</p>

<p>
Nice to meet You! Currently, I am majoring in aerospace and software engineering at Gyeongsang National University,
I am the photographer of Gonapus, an astronomical observation club, and the design part of UMC, an app launching club.
I'm still very interested in many fields, so I'm learning wide and shallow, but I'm planning to settle down in one soon and create my own portfolio here.
